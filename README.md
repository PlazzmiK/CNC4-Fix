# Loader/Fix for Command & Conquer 4

Some Windows 10/11 systems can't run the Steam C&C 4 version. It throws and error (culture ID 8192) when launching the game, preventing you from playing your official game.
This small batch file skips the launcher and loads the game without any problems.

### How to use

Just put the **run_CNC4.bat** file inside the main C&C4 folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight).
To start the game, execute the run_CNC4.bat file and the game will start.
When you run the file, it will ask for admin rights. This is to correctly run the main game.

### Have fun!
